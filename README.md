# Abyss Client™ Beta Version Enforcer

So you want to have the ULTIMATE Abyss Client™ experience, huh? Wow, what are you, a masochist?

This mod, when combined with Abyss Client™, adds some new modules to it like Surround2 or WebChat whatever that shit is. Nobody cares about Abyss Client™ except LATINX people so why should I?

# [ how-to ]

</div>

1. Get Abyss Client™ from [here](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Abyss) and this mod from [here](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/AbyssBetaEnforcer/releases)
2. Put everything in .minecraft/mods (you should have Forge installed)
3. Run the game, you should see a couple of new modules and settings to them
